⚠️ **Disclaimer: Community-Driven Effort** ⚠️

Please note that this handbook is not officially endorsed by the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission or any associated organizations. By sharing our research out in the `open`, I am hoping that the SWOT community can expedite the convergence of algorithsm as well as the future science returns of the mission in an unprecedented speed. While we strive for accuracy, the contents herein are subject to constant change and should be used as a guiding resource rather than an authoritative document. Please also consider yourself as the community that makes such rapid change and improvements.

Launched on December 16, 2022, SWOT has successfully navigated through various critical phases, including deployment, instrument check-out, resolution of power outages, a fast-repeat 1-day calibration and validation stage, and an orbit transition to its 21-day repeat science orbit.

As the first mission of its kind, both the science data system and the algorithms are still under development, aiming to produce science-quality data. The process of calibration and validation remains an ongoing effort. At present, access to intermediate data products is restricted to select groups, specifically those involved in calibration, validation, science, and algorithm development.

This handbook is designed for individuals who are new to analyzing these intermediate products. Our aim is to expedite the journey toward well-calibrated and validated SWOT data products that can be utilized by the broader scientific community.

The handbook is organized as follows:

- [Chapter 1 reviews the SWOT science products, with a focus on Level-2 SSH, and lists the associated technical documents.](chap1_product_review)
- Chapter 2 provides information on data access from AVISO and PO.DAAC.
- Chapter 3 includes examples of quick analyses of SWOT products, along with links to notebook tutorials in [this repository](https://github.com/podaac/SWOT-OpenToolkit).
- Chapter 4 explains the core code and algorithms used in this handbook, built by the community, as well as the science algorithm codes used by the project (work in progress).
- Chapter 5 presents preliminary results from the mission's calibration and validation efforts and the associated software.
- Chapter 6 ensembles existing SWOT-oriented product and science algorithms and the links to the open-source codes.
